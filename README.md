Welcome to the **ALRABVepizootiology** repository! This project was completed for my Master of Science thesis research:
## Raccoon (Procyon lotor) Rabies in Alabama: Insights from Historical Trends, Oral Rabies Vaccine Bait Fate, and Spatial Epizootiology

In the eastern United States, the raccoon (*Procyon lotor*) is the primary rabies virus reservoir. Currently[2024], Alabama represents the western-most extent of raccoon rabies virus variant in the US. The foundation of the project was rooted in a One Health approach, recognizing that effective rabies control not only safeguards public health but also reduces threat to pets, livestock, and wildlife conservation. Successful implementation of a wildlife rabies control program in Alabama requires collaboration across sectors and disciplines, integrating surveillance, vaccination, and education efforts to mitigate the disease's impact.
