## Raccoon (Procyon lotor) Rabies in Alabama: Insights from Historical Trends, Oral Rabies Vaccine Bait Fate, and Spatial Epizootiology

In the eastern United States, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) is the main carrier of the rabies virus. As of 2024, Alabama marks the westernmost limit of the raccoon rabies variant. This project follows a One Health approach, recognizing that managing rabies protects not only public health but also pets, livestock, and local wildlife. Effective rabies control in Alabama relies on collaboration across different sectors, combining surveillance, vaccination, and education to reduce the diseaseâ€™s impact.
