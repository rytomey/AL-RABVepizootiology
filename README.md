## Raccoon (Procyon lotor) Rabies in Alabama: Insights from Historical Trends, Oral Rabies Vaccine Bait Fate, and Spatial Epizootiology

Welcome to the **ALRABVepizootiology** repository! This project is part of my Master of Science thesis research focused on understanding raccoon rabies dynamics in Alabama. The study examines historical trends, the fate of oral rabies vaccine baits, and the spatial patterns of raccoon rabies spread.

## 📚 Project Overview

Rabies, caused by the *Lyssavirus* genus, remains a significant zoonotic threat in wildlife. 
In the southeastern United States, the raccoon (*Procyon lotor*) is the primary rabies virus reservoir.
This repository documents my research efforts to explore:

- **Historical Rabies Trends** in Alabama
- **Oral Rabies Vaccine (ORV) Bait Fate** analysis
- **Spatial Epizootiology** of raccoon rabies

## 🎯 Research Goals

- **Analyze** historical rabies data in Alabama
- **Evaluate** the uptake and competition of ORV baits by target and non-target species
- **Map and Model** the spatial dynamics of rabies spread among raccoon populations

## 🔬 Methodology

The project involves several key components:

1. **Data Collection**: Field surveys with camera traps, historical data archives, and spatial mapping.
2. **Bait Fate Analysis**: Assess ORV bait uptake by raccoons and competitors across diverse habitats.
3. **Spatial Analysis**: Use GIS and statistical models to explore rabies spread patterns.

## 📊 Data and Analysis

This repository contains:

- **Data**: Raw and processed datasets
- **Scripts**: R scripts for data analysis

## 🌍 Impact

This research aims to contribute significantly to the understanding and management of raccoon rabies in Alabama and beyond:

- **Public Health**: By improving ORV strategies, the study seeks to reduce rabies transmission, protecting humans, pets, and livestock from this fatal disease.
- **Wildlife Management**: The project provides insights into historical trends, oral rabies vaccine bait uptake, and spatial  helping wildlife managers implement more effective control measures.
- **Ecological Understanding**: A deeper knowledge of bait competition and raccoon ecology can refine conservation strategies, aiding in the management of rabies across diverse landscapes.
- **Policy Guidance**: The study's findings could guide future rabies management policies and funding priorities, ensuring resources are directed efficiently for optimal impact.
